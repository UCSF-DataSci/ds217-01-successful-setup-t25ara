# Getting to Know You

Welcome to DS217! Please take a few minutes to introduce yourself by answering these questions. There are no right or wrong answers - we just want to get to know you better and understand what you're hoping to get from this course.

## 1. Who are you and what's your background?
[Tell us a bit about yourself - your field of study, professional background, interests, or anything else you'd like to share]
A little about myself, my name is Tara Hosseini. I majored in biological sciences at UCI and graduated in 2023. After I graduated I worked in cancer research at UCSD as a SRA where I was introduced to the field of computational biology.This sparked my interest to apply to this program. Outside of my academic pursuits I love to draw, paint, try new coffee shops, and hang out with friends. I also love to play board games, specifically catan. 

## 2. What are you looking for out of this class?
[What do you hope to gain? Specific skills, knowledge, applications, career goals?]
I am looking to improve my python knowledge but most importantly improve my application of knowledge. I have learned alittle bit but I want to solidify my foundation through practice with the language. 

## 3. What are you most looking forward to or tentative about?
[What excites you about programming/data science? What concerns or uncertainties do you have?]
What excites me is the pursuit of knowledge and problem solving. I love analyzing data, this was my favorite part of my work at UCSD so to be doing it as the main portion of my work is exciting. I am only scared about getting jobs after I graduate as a lot of people have told me discouraging things but I hope they are not well informed or that it wont be the case for me. 
## 4. Share something you enjoy!
[Drop a link to something you really enjoy - could be a website, article, video, project, hobby, book, podcast, or anything else you're into]
I've been watching a lot of movies lately so my link will be netflix.com
